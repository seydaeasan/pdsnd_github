# Bikeshare Data Analysis

This project provides a Python program to explore and analyze bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. The program allows users to filter data by city, month, and day of the week, generating various statistics to help understand bikeshare usage patterns.

## Features

The program includes the following features:
1. **Filtering Data**: Users can filter data by city (Chicago, New York City, or Washington), month (January to June), and day of the week.
2. **Time Statistics**: Insights into the most common travel times, including the most common month, day, and start hour.
3. **Station Statistics**: Displays the most popular start and end stations, as well as the most common trip combinations.
4. **Trip Duration Statistics**: Computes total and average trip durations.
5. **User Statistics**: Shows statistics on different user types, gender distribution (where available), and birth year data.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Required Libraries**: You can install the necessary libraries with the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy
  ```

## Dataset

The project utilizes the following data files:
- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`

Each dataset contains information on bikeshare usage for its respective city, with columns such as:
- `Start Time`
- `End Time`
- `Trip Duration`
- `Start Station`
- `End Station`
- `User Type`
- `Gender` (not available for Washington)
- `Birth Year` (not available for Washington)

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Place the dataset files (`chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, and `washington.csv`) in the same directory as the script.
3. Execute the script using a Python interpreter:
   ```bash
   python bikeshare.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select a city, month, and day for analysis.

## Usage Instructions

1. **City Selection**: Choose a city from the options provided (Chicago, New York City, or Washington).
2. **Month Selection**: Filter data by a specific month (January to June) or analyze all months.
3. **Day Selection**: Choose to filter data by a specific day of the week or analyze all days.
4. The program will then calculate and display various statistics based on your selections.
5. After viewing the results, you will be prompted to restart the program or exit.

## Code Structure

The program is organized into several functions:
- **`get_filters()`**: Handles user input for filtering criteria (city, month, day).
- **`load_data(city, month, day)`**: Loads and filters data based on user selections.
- **`time_stats(df)`**: Calculates and displays the most frequent travel times.
- **`station_stats(df)`**: Displays the most popular stations and trip combinations.
- **`trip_duration_stats(df)`**: Provides statistics on trip durations.
- **`user_stats(df)`**: Offers insights into user demographics and patterns.
- **`main()`**: The main function orchestrating the program flow, calling the above functions in sequence.

## Example Output

Here’s a sample output of the program:

```
Hello! Let's explore some US bikeshare data!
Please enter the city name (chicago, new york city, washington): chicago
Please enter the month (all, january, february, ... , june): march
Please enter the day of the week (all, monday, tuesday, ... sunday): all

Calculating The Most Frequent Times of Travel...
Most Common Month: March
Most Common Day of Week: Tuesday
Most Common Start Hour: 17

Calculating The Most Popular Stations and Trip...
Most Commonly Used Start Station: Streeter Dr & Grand Ave
Most Commonly Used End Station: Streeter Dr & Grand Ave
Most Frequent Combination of Start Station and End Station Trip: ('Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St', 'Streeter Dr & Grand Ave')

...
Would you like to restart? Enter yes or no.
```

## Error Handling

The program includes basic error handling for user input. If an invalid city, month, or day is entered, the program will prompt the user to try again.
